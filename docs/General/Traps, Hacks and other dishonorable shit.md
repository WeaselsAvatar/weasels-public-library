# Traps, Hacks and other dishonorable shit

## Traps

Traps are as old as tool usage. A covered pit, sharpened sticks in the ground, tripwires

Traps, be they improvised or professionally made, are intended to deny ground and damage a target, physically and psychologically. Some of the more evil ones aren't even intended to kill outright but to bind resources by forcing the enemy to tend to an injured comrade. Bam, that's three people out.

### Traps in the urban environment

* A shotgun wired to a door handle. For extra evilness, load it with some sci-fi anti-riot frag shells which lodge pieces in the wound that don't come out.
* A hole in the floor, covered with a carpet
* Claymore mines, grenades, EMP emitters
* Spray cans and gasoline in a microwave
* Gun turrets with pre-loaded IFF systems
* Trip wires and sling with razor wire
* Something, something, *glass shards*

## Hacks

### Do not think about blue elephants

Hacking in a cyberpunk (or generally modern) environment, be it for profit, activism or pranks, is usually based on a simple principle:

*If I know how a system responds to a certain input, I can then maybe change or manipulate that input to get a different response.*

This is not limited to machines, but people as well. Look at the chapter title. Do you see the blue elephant?

* Modify the *context* of any given information to mean something completely different.
* Convince a system that it has to respond in a certain way (triggering a fire alarm causes doors to open, a silouette of a gunman in the shadows causes a guard to investigate or open fire)

Machines (especially low-level AIs) are in some ways easier to hack than people because they are missing several abstraction layers humans have. If a machine is told to fill a tank from a bottle labeled "Water", it will probably do so, even if the bottle is filled with gasoline. A human would probably wonder about the smell.
