### Automated Damage Control

The ship is fitted with an automated support system, helping with crucial and quick repairs during ship-to-ship combat. When activated, drones are sent out to quickly assess damage and provide repair support.

When used to repair the ship during combat, the drones provide a +1 skill bonus to the Fix skill for frigates, a +2 bonus for cruisers and a +3 bonus for capital ships.
Alternatively, the system may be used to perform automated field repairs instead of the ships engineer. This requires a Program (6) check. 
As long as sufficient spare parts are available as per the game rules, the system can repair lost hit points autonomously. It can not jury-rig damaged systems, however.

### BioSkin Armor Plating

Created from patents when researching ReGel on the world of Dundee in the McDonald system, BioSkin Armor is a semi-biological armor plating that is capable of self-repair. The armor functions just as the *Augmented Plating* fitting but it can repair itself if it becomes damaged or is destroyed. The armor can repair one point of damage per day. If it was destroyed, it regrows itself within a month.

### Enhanced Hydroponics

Works just like the *Hydroponic Production* fitting, but due to breakthroughs during ReGel research, this fitting can be installed in much smaller ships.

### Predictive Wiring

Due to breakthroughs in neuroelectrics, ship systems may be outfitted with biotech circuits that can try to anticipate future events. The base system has to be installed into the general wiring of the ship. Each system needs to be integrated into the network with specialized adapters. Integrating a system costs an additional 25K Cr. When integrating a system, the buyer has to decide if the predictive wiring grants 

* A re-roll as per the rules for Expert classes
* A +1 Bonus for skill checks rolled when using the system

This decision is final and can only be changed by rewiring the system.
