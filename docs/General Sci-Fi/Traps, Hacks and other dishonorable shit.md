# Traps, Hacks and other dishonorable shit



## This is us

*Look at us, man. I mean humans.
Killing one another over the pettiest shit. Status, power, mating opportunities, resources, energy. Fuck this H+ Humanity_2.0 bullshit, man. We're still apes, just out of the trees. Baseline tribalism hardwired. 
See these AR-Tags and HoloAds around us, barely covering the crumbling concrete? They know and they tell your lizard brain what you need, what you want. Ad targeting has come a long way. These projectors, they use some modified algos that were initially intended for threat pattern detection in crowds. Full sensor package, thermal, body language, microexpression pattern recognition. 
And they show you things, images, sounds, just a blip, you'd never notice consciously, but your lizard brain knows. The real ad package, the one you see, comes after, targeted at you directly, at the ape...we invent the craziest shit and what do we use it for? Smarter systems to sell you more shit that sells you more shit. Recursion, see recursion.
Aaaanyway, you know those control systems that connect your iDent to your PAN to your visual cortex so you can see and process all this shit? According to my friend over there they are a bit glitchy when not properly upgraded and can have some hilarious side-effects when presented with specific light and sound patterns. Just like the ones in a hacked HoloAd. 
That's why you can't move.
That's why your fear responses are off the scale. Some animal part of you knows there are tigers lurking in the grass.
Fight, flight, freeze. Guess what. 
You've heard of Jace, right? Big girl, owns the club on 28th, runs a delivery service, hates it when some assholes take one of her deliveries for a ride? Deliveries that belong to some really scary people? 
Deliveries that Jace promises her customers to be on time, no questions asked? She has a reputation to uphold here, man.
One of you is gonna tell what you have done with it. 
And who paid you. 
And who shot the driver, who, as it happens, is Jaces cousin.
Don't worry about what they'll do to you. I'm here, they are not. And Jace liked her cousin more than you. Tribalism and all that. 
Look at the alternative...
If you don't talk, I'm just gonna leave you here under your tree until the predators come out to play and target some ads at people from your iDent contacts.*



## Traps

Traps are as old as tool usage. A covered pit, sharpened sticks in the ground, tripwires

Traps, be they improvised or professionally made, are intended to deny ground and damage a target, physically and psychologically. Some of the more evil ones aren't even intended to kill outright but to bind resources by forcing the enemy to tend to an injured comrade. Bam, that's three people out.

### Traps in the urban environment

* A shotgun wired to a door handle. For extra evilness, load it with some sci-fi anti-riot frag shells which lodge pieces in the wound that don't come out.
* A hole in the floor, covered with a carpet
* Claymore mines, grenades, EMP emitters
* Spray cans and gasoline in a microwave
* Gun turrets with pre-loaded IFF systems
* Trip wires and sling with razor wire
* Something, something, *glass shards*

## Hacks

### Do not think about blue elephants!

Hacking in a cyberpunk (or generally modern) environment, be it for profit, activism or pranks, is usually based on a simple principle: 

*If I know how a system responds to a certain input, I can then maybe change or manipulate that input to get a different response.*

This is not limited to machines, but people as well. Look at the chapter title. Do you see the blue elephant?

* Modify the *context* of any given information to mean something completely different.
* Convince a system that it has to respond in a certain way (triggering a fire alarm causes doors to open, a silouette of a gunman in the shadows causes a guard to investigate or open fire)

Machines (especially low-level AIs) are in some ways easier to hack than people because they are missing several abstraction layers humans have. If a machine is told to fill a tank from a bottle labeled "Water", it will probably do so, even if the bottle is filled with gasoline. A human would probably wonder about the smell.   

### "Im Arsch"

*(German, slang, vulg., lit. "up the ass". Not functioning anymore. Too tired or injured to be useful. Closest English approximation: fucked (up)/kaput/knackered/finished/broken)*
