# This is us

> Look at us, man. I mean humans.
>
> Killing one another over the pettiest shit. Status, power, mating opportunities, resources, energy. Fuck this H+ Humanity_2.0 bullshit, man. We're still apes, just out of the trees. Baseline tribalism hardwired.
>
> See these AR-Tags and HoloAds around us, barely covering the crumbling concrete? They know and they tell your lizard brain what you need, what you want. Ad targeting has come a long way. These projectors, they use some modified algos that were initially intended for threat pattern detection in crowds. Full sensor package, thermal, body language, microexpression pattern recognition.
>
> And they show you things, images, sounds, just a blip, you'd never notice consciously, but your lizard brain knows. The real ad package, the one you see, comes after, targeted at you directly, at the ape...we invent the craziest shit and what do we use it for? Smarter systems to sell you more shit that sells you more shit. Recursion, see recursion.

> Aaaanyway, you know those control systems that connect your iDent to your PAN to your visual cortex so you can see and process all this shit? According to my friend over there they are a bit glitchy when not properly upgraded and can have some hilarious side-effects when presented with specific light and sound patterns. Just like the ones in a hacked HoloAd.

> That's why you can't move.

> That's why your fear responses are off the scale. Some animal part of you knows there are tigers lurking in the grass.
>
> Fight, flight, freeze.
>
> Guess what.

> You've heard of Jace, right? Big girl, owns the club on 28th, runs a delivery service, hates it when some assholes take one of her deliveries for a ride? Deliveries that belong to some really scary people?
> Deliveries that Jace promises her customers to be on time, no questions asked? She has a reputation to uphold here, man.
>
> One of you is gonna tell what you have done with it.
> And who paid you.
> And who shot the driver, who, as it happens, is Jaces cousin.
>
> Don't worry about what they'll do to you. I'm here, they are not. And Jace liked her cousin more than you. Tribalism and all that.
> Look at the alternative...
> If you don't talk, I'm just gonna leave you here under your tree until the predators come out to play and target some ads at people from your iDent contacts.
