# Weasels Public Library

A collection of random tables and other documentation for tabletop role-playing games, some in German, some in English, some an amalgamation thereof.

## Document Navigation

- [Fluff](./docs/Fluff/fluff-index.md) contains some fluff texts for various games.
- [General](./docs/General/generali-index.md) Contains system-neutral rules and musings
- [Pathfinder](./docs/Pathfinder/pathfinder-index.md) some Pathfinder related documents
- [VTT](./docs/VTT/vtt-index.md) contains all sorts of stuff for use with virtual tabletops (like Roll20 or Foundry VTT)
- [X Without Number](./docs/X%20Without%20Number/x-without-number-index.md) contains content specific to Sine Nomine Publishings ...Without Number games (Random tables, rules, etc.)

## Codes

The macro codes in `/src/foundry-vtt/macros` can be used in Foundry by copying the code into a [new macro](https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/) (slight adaptions may be necessary).

The roll tables in `/src/foundry-vtt/stars-without-number/rolltables` can be [imported](https://foundryvtt.com/article/roll-tables/) into any Foundry world using the [Stars Without Number / Cities Without Number](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/swnr) system . When using the tables from a folder I recommend importing all tables in the folder as most of them are dependent on each other.
